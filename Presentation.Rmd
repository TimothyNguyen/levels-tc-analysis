## Why is it important?

-   If you're looking to make more money in your career, understanding how it works and where companies offer higher TC will help you set goals more realistically.
-   Good for negotiation and you can see how you're being compensated compared to your peers at the company.
-   Understanding in which areas companies will pay more money as an employee
-   Understanding what you can expect to be paid as a Software Engineer vs Product Manager vs Data Scientist

## Conclusion

-   Some of the locations where you're most likely going to make the most money based of YOE:

    -   Entry-Level (0 - 2 years): Menlo Park, CA; San Bruno, CA; Mountain View, CA

    -   Mid-Level (2 - 5 years): Los Gatos, CA; Trenton, NJ

    -   Senior Level (5 - 10 Years): Highland Park, NJ; Meno Park, CA; Flint, MI

    -   Above (10+ Years): Chapel Hill, NC; Los Gatos, CA
